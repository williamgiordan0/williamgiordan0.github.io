      <p>Hey there, I see you found my page, not sure if you could tell what my name is. I go by Will by the way, nice to meet you, virtually! I currently reside in Paramus, New Jersey,
        but am very open to relocating on what ever job opportunity comes my way. I graduated from Montclair State University with Bachelors of Science with a study in Earth and Environmental Science. I now have my certification
        in Data Science and Coding from Rutgers University. My knowledge about computers is extremely exceptional and I believe I would be a perfect candidate
        for a job in the Data Science and coding industry. I know a lot about weather and am very passionate about that as well. Feel free to check out my contact information below and
        get in contact with me at any time! <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
